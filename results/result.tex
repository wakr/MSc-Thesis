Following chapters describe the results we gathered during the evaluation of our models. All results are generated using Python version 3.6.0 and scikit-learn version 0.19.1. 

As explained in the Chapter \ref{chap-method-evaluation}, we first evaluate both models individually and lastly combine the results to create a final prediction which is evaluated by a human expert.
