\subsection{Evaluation} \label{chap-method-evaluation}

We first introduce a metric called \emph{accuracy}, which can be used in both binary and multiclass evaluation. Accuracy score, simply being the fraction between correct predictions and the total number of predictions, can be defined by using the confusion matrix given in Chapter \ref{chap-bg-sim} as

\begin{equation}
    ACC = \dfrac{TP + TN}{TP + TN + FP + FN}
\end{equation}

Both models of our approach are first evaluated against the data. This means that the similarity detection part uses SOCO to tune its parameters ($n$-gram and $\varepsilon$) and evaluate the performance of our model. Evaluation happens by reporting average precision and $F_1$-metric of document retrieval, and we mainly focus on the amount of correctly classified documents retrieved. After the hyperparameters for the similarity detection have been tuned, we compare it by calculating the agreement to the state of the art software plagiarism detection called JPlag \cite{prechelt2002finding}. The agreement with respect to the JPlag is based on the Jaccard similarity, which was given in Chapter \ref{chap-liter-review-methods} between two sets and we expect Jaccard similarity to be close to one, as our methods should get similar results as the JPlag. However, we can't say for sure that did JPlag retrieve all possible cases of plagiarism, thus we don't have direct access to true classes without going through every possible document in OHPE/OHJA. This means we can't calculate precision nor recall for the plagiarism detection, and we must resort to human judgement to base our final evaluation. 

%$A, B$ as

%    J(A,B) = sim(A,B) = \dfrac{|A \cap B|}{|A \cup B|}
%\end{equation}





When evaluating the authorship identification, our classification problem is no longer binary. It's a multiclass classification problem, and in order to use $F_1$-score, it must be redefined. The multiclass-version of the $F_1$-score, which treats all classes equally, is called \emph{macro-averaged $F_1$} \cite{SOKOLOVA2009427}. It's defined as 

\begin{equation}
    F_M = 2 \cdot \dfrac{\text{Precision}_M \cdot \text{Recall}_M}{\text{Precision}_M + \text{Recall}_M}
\end{equation}

\noindent
Where $\text{Precision}_M$ and $\text{Recall}_M$ are averaged over every class as

\begin{equation}
    \text{Precision}_M = \dfrac{\sum \limits_{c \in \mathbb{C}}
        \frac{TP_c}
             {TP_c + FP_c}}
    {|\mathbb{C}|}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    \text{Recall}_M = \dfrac{\sum \limits_{c \in \mathbb{C}}
        \frac{TP_c}
             {TP_c + FN_c}}
    {|\mathbb{C}|}
\end{equation}



\noindent
Using above metrics for a multiclass classification, we are able to tune the parameter $n$ which controls the length of character-level $n$-grams. Tuning is done by first dividing both OHPE and OHJA into seven splits which corresponds each week, then taking the set of authors who submitted and using their previous work as a training data, finally predicting the authors of the last exercises and collecting calculating the average performance. For example, when we evaluate our authorship identification on the first week of OHPE, we take the subset of authors $A' \subseteq A$ who submitted to the last exercise of the first week. Then the last exercise is left out as the test data, and for each author $a \in A'$, we collect their submissions to form the training data. 


Our final result will be a set of detected documents for both OHPE's and OHJA's exam tasks, and we will use a human expert who manually goes through the retrieved documents and classifies which ones she considers as real plagiarism. By using a human judgement, we get as unbiased and realistic evaluation as possible, but also information about the decision process. When the human expert has gone through all documents and evaluated them, we calculate following four metrics to score our final result: number of true positives, number of false positives, detected cluster sizes and Jaccard similarity.
